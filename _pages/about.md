<h3>About Me</h3>

<span class="small_font">I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS">Oregon State University</a>, Corvallis, OR, USA, in the Deep Machine Vision Group.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
<h5>Research Experiece</h5>I have had the privilege of working with some of the top research labs in India, where I served as a Research Fellow at IIT Kharagpur, a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow at RBCDSAI, IIT Madras, and a Research Fellow at IIT Dharwad under the guidance of Nikhil Hegde, Ayan Chaudhury, Amlan Barua. I am also a recipeint of AI fellowship from Pi School Rome, Italy where I worked under the supervision of Sébastien Bratières
