<span class="small_font">I am a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), where I am advised by Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~ayanc/">Ayan Chaudhary </a> at the Visual Information Processing(VIP) Lab.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Prior to joining IIT-KGP, I served as a Post Baccalaureate Fellow at RBCDSAI, IIT-Madras. Before that, I worked as a Research Fellow at IIT-Dharwad under the guidance of Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://hegden.github.io/">Nikhil Hegde</a>.

<h3>Research Interest</h3>

<span class="small_font">My interest lies at the intersection of <b>3D computer vision and Robotics</b>. The noteworthy progress made in vision and language technology within the domain of AI research has led to groundbreaking commercial products that have profoundly influenced society. Nonetheless, what genuinely fascinates me is the potential of these models to undertake mission-critical tasks, such as autonomous robotic surgery. My ultimate goal is to actively contribute to the development of intelligent systems that possess the ability to make intricate decisions and foster positive transformations in our world.</span>
